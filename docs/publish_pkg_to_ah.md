# Publish KCL Package

In this guide, we will show you how to publish your KCL package to the kcl-lang official registry with a `helloworld` example. You can find the published packages in AH (artifacthub.io).

## Prerequisites

- Install [kpm](https://kcl-lang.io/docs/user_docs/guides/package-management/installation/)
- Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Register a Github account (optional, you need a github account)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)

## Code Repository

NOTE: If you want to publish your KCL package to the kcl-lang official registry, then the source code of your KCL package will be saved in [Github Repo: https://github.com/kcl-lang/artifacthub)](https://github.com/kcl-lang/artifacthub), you need to submit the source code of your package to this repository via PR.

## Quick Start
In the next section, we will show you how to publish your package with a `helloworld` example.

### 1. Clone the code repository

First, you need to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/kcl-lang/artifacthub --depth=1
```

### 2. Create a branch for your package

We recommend that your branch name be: `publish-pkg-<pkg_name>`, `<pkg_name>` is the name of your package.

Take the package `helloworld` as an example

Enter the artifacthub directory you downloaded
```
cd artifacthub
```

Create a branch `publish-pkg-helloworld` for the package `helloworld`
```
git checkout -b publish-pkg-helloworld
```

### 3. Add your KCL package

You need to move your package to the current directory. In our example, we use the `kpm init` command to create the package `helloworld`

```
kpm init helloworld
```

You can add a `README.md` file to the root directory of the package to display on the homepage of AH.
```
echo "## Introduction" >> helloworld/README.md
echo "This is a kcl package named helloworld." >> helloworld/README.md
```

### 4. Commit your package

You can use the following command to commit your package

Use `git add .` command to add your package to the staging area of git

```
git add .
```

Use `git commit -s` command to commit your package, we recommend that your commit message follow the format "publish package <pkg_name>".
```
git commit -m"publish package helloworld" -s
```

Use `git push` command to submit your package to your branch `publish-pkg-<pkg_name>`

```
git push
```

### 5. Submit a PR

Finally, you need to submit a PR to the main branch of the repository with your branch `publish-pkg-<pkg_name>`.
