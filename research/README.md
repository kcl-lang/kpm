# [WIP] Version management strategies

## Abstract
This documentation presents the design and implementation of a version management system tailored for managing dependencies in KCL project. The system encompasses functionalities such as viewing detailed module information, installing dependencies, handling replacements and exclusions, as well as performing upgrades and downgrades. Each functionality is discussed in detail along with example usage scenarios and implementation strategies.

## Introduction
Version management plays a critical role in software development, especially when dealing with complex dependency structures. Managing dependencies effectively ensures project stability, compatibility, and ease of maintenance. In this documentation, we propose a comprehensive version management system equipped with various functionalities to address the challenges of dependency management.

## Operations on Build Lists

1. View:
The view functionality allows users to retrieve detailed information about modules and their dependencies. This feature aids developers in understanding the structure of their project's dependencies and identifying potential issues. Information such as version numbers, dependencies, and metadata can be queried.

2. Install:
The install command enables users to download and install dependencies for a project. It automatically resolves dependencies and ensures that the correct versions are installed to prevent conflicts. This functionality streamlines the setup process for new projects and ensures consistent development environments.

3. Replacement:
The replacement functionality allows substituting a module with another one, altering the module graph to accommodate different dependencies. This feature is useful when a particular module needs to be replaced with a compatible alternative without affecting other dependencies.

4. Exclusion:
Exclusion functionality removes specific versions of a module from consideration during dependency resolution, redirecting requirements to the next higher version. This feature enables users to exclude problematic versions or temporarily bypass certain dependencies.

5. Upgrades:
The upgrade functionality updates modules to newer versions, potentially adding or removing indirect dependencies. This feature ensures that projects stay up-to-date with the latest enhancements and bug fixes while maintaining compatibility with existing dependencies.

6. Downgrades:
The downgrade functionality reverts modules to previous versions, potentially removing higher versions and their dependent modules. This feature is valuable when encountering issues with newer versions or when reverting to a known stable state.

## Implementation

The version management system is implemented as a command-line tool, providing users with a familiar interface for interacting with dependencies. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration into existing development workflows.

Example usage scenario demonstrating the functionalities of the version management system:

 ```bash
$ kpm view <module_name>
```
 ```bash
$ kpm install
```
 ```bash
$ kpm replace <old_module> <new_module>
```
 ```bash
$ kpm upgrade <module>
```
 ```bash
$ kpm downgrade <module> <version>
```
