# Enhancement Proposal: Validation of Required Fields (`name` and `version`) in `kcl.mod` During Push Operations

### Author:- Ravjot Singh

## Overview

The enhancement focuses on ensuring that the `kcl.mod` file contains the essential fields `name` and `version` before a KCL package is pushed to an OCI registry. This validation aims to improve package integrity, prevent errors during the push process, and maintain consistency within the OCI repository.


## Background

The `kpm push` command is utilized to upload KCL packages to an OCI (Open Container Initiative) registry. Currently, the command may proceed without verifying the presence of critical metadata fields (`name` and `version`) in the `kcl.mod` file. This omission can lead to incomplete or inconsistent packages being pushed, which may cause issues in package management and dependency resolution.

## Proposed Solution

### Design

To address the issue, the enhancement involves adding validation checks for the `name` and `version` fields within the `kcl.mod` file. These checks will be integrated into the functions responsible for loading and pushing the package, ensuring that validation occurs at the appropriate stage of the push process.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Validation Logic**: Verify the presence of `name` and `version` in `kcl.mod` immediately after loading the package.
2.  **Error Handling**: Provide clear and descriptive error messages if validation fails, guiding users to rectify the issues.
3.  **Code Integration**: Embed the validation within the `pushCurrentPackage` and `pushTarPackage` functions to maintain separation of concerns and avoid redundant package loading.





## Conclusion

Implementing validation for the `name` and `version` fields in the `kcl.mod` file during push operations is a critical enhancement that ensures package integrity, consistency, and reliability within the OCI registry. By integrating validation directly into the package loading functions (`pushCurrentPackage` and `pushTarPackage`), the solution maintains a clean separation of concerns, avoids redundant operations, and provides clear feedback to users.
